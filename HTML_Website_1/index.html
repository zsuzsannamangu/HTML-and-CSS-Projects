				<p>Reduce - Reuse - ReTreat™ is a small chocolate business based in Portland, OR. I started this business in February 2021, when I realized that I cannot find any chocolate that comes in returnable packaging. As our family lives as low waste as possible, we try to refill and reuse everything. I get all our cleaning and skincare products from refill businesses, we use our own containers and mugs when we get take out or we use GoBox, we make our own plant-based milk, etc. (Of course, we’re nowhere perfect, ignore that disposable coffee cup sitting in my garbage can, when yesterday I was desperate to get a latte, and I didn’t have my own mug).</p>
				<p><span style="color:dodgerblue">ReTreat's packaging is zero waste.</span> Single use plastic packaging has had a detrimental effect on our earth's ecosystem. Your chocolates and truffles will come in an aluminum container. This can be returned and reused. Please, please return them!! These tins are resistant to corrosion, so they can be washed and sanitized over and over again. Aluminum is lightweight and durable. If your tin has a dent or damaged, you can still return it, I will recycle it for you. Also, the paper liner at the bottom is <span style="color:dodgerblue">compostable</span>.</p>
				<p>ReTreat's ingredients are <span style="color:dodgerblue">locally sourced</span> whenever possible. I believe that supporting local farmers is crucial to environmental sustainability. Even if it costs more to get these ingredients, it worths it for our planet and economy. Imported ingredients are ethically made and fair trade.</p>
				<p>And what about the <span style="color:dodgerblue">cacao</span> itself? That is of course the most important ingredient. I use only fair trade cacao, sourced from farms using sustainable methods, from the Dominican Republic, Ecuador and Guatemala. I traveled to Guatemala in Spring 2022 and visited the farms where the cacao is grown and the Mayan indigenous collectives where it is prepared. It was an amazing experience. The Guatemalan cacao I use is pure ceremonial cacao, which means the cacao is fermented in small batches, toasted over wood fire and hand peeled.</p>
